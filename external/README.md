# External, third-party dependencies

This directory holds source code for third-party libraries used by Mg Engine.

The libraries are stored in the archive `mg_dependencies.zip`. There is also a submodules directory,
but it is only used to generate the dependencies archive (see `update_dependency_archive.sh`).
