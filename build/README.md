The scripts in this directory are provided as a convenience for building.  They are not mandatory,
it is possible to build using CMake as with any other CMake project. But they simplify configuration
and build, as a convenience, and demonstrate some of mg-engine's build options.

Usage: run `build_dependencies.sh` first, then configure with your compiler(s) of choice, e.g.
`./configure clang gcc`. The `run_test_scene.sh` script is a convenience for building and running
the `test_scene` sample.
