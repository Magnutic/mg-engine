/* Divides the view space frustum into a grid of tiles. Used for the Tiled Rendering and Clustered
 * Rendering techniques.
 *
 * In tiled rendering, the screen is divided into a set of tiles (see defs::light_grid_xxx). For
 * each tile, the set of light sources potentially affecting that tile is found and added to a list.
 * Then, the fragment shader calculates the tile in which it is located, and applies all lights
 * listed in said tile's light-list. This allows arbitrary number of lights in a scene in a manner
 * more efficient and flexible than per-object light-lists.
 *
 * Clustered rendering is an extension of tiled rendering, where depth is also taken into account --
 * each screen-space tile now corresponds to several projection-space clusters (see
 * defs::light_grid_depth). This allows more precise light lists, with less redundant light
 * calculations for tiles with large depth disparity.
 *
 * For more details, research 'Tiled Rendering' and 'Clustered Rendering'.
 * The original whitepaper is available here (as of March 2018):
 *     http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/clustered_shading_preprint.pdf
